              If you're reading this, there's a solid chance you've also looked at code for the first time and thought:
              <br />
              <strong>"What the heck is this alien stuff?"</strong>
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Yeah, same here. Let me take you back.</p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              I was in Class 6, just vibing at tuition, minding my own business.
              <br />
              At the back of the room? A bunch of seniors, deep in their laptops ‚Äî full hacker mode.
              <br />
              No games. No YouTube.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Just black screens filled with:
              <br />
              <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> ‚Äî flying across like The
              Matrix, junior edition.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              And then one of them casually said:
              <br />
              <br />
              <em>"Do the code like this."</em>
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              I had no idea what "code" even meant.
              <br />I didn't ask.
              <br />
              Not because I was shy ‚Äî just curious, quietly observing.
              <br />
              Trying to figure out what on earth they were doing.
              <br />I was like:
              <br />
              <strong>"What the heck is this sorcery?!"</strong> üòµ‚Äçüí´
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              That evening, I went home.
              <br />
              Opened Google like a true digital warrior.
              <br />
              Typed in:
              <br />üëâ <strong>"What is coding?"</strong>
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              And boom.
              <br />
              Welcome to the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Journey Begins</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              HTML?
              <br />
              Not bad. Kinda chill. Made me feel smart. Like, "Hey, I built something!"
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              CSS?
              <br />
              Okay okay... fonts, colors, spacing. Felt like decorating a digital room.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              JavaScript?
              <br />
              BRO. Literal headache.
              <br />
              One missing semicolon and it'd just break like a toddler who missed nap time.
              <br />
              Errors everywhere. Confusion at max.
              <br />
              But still ‚Äî I didn't stop.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              I built weird, ugly little websites.
              <br />
              The kind that looked like they were made in MS Paint‚Ä¶ but to me?
              <br />
              They were masterpieces.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              No tutorials.
              <br />
              No classes.
              <br />
              No seniors helping.
              <br />
              Just me, Google, and 43 open tabs of Stack Overflow pain.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Fast Forward to Now</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Now?
              <br />I know what that "hacker stuff" was.
              <br />I write real code.
              <br />
              Build real things.
              <br />
              Fix real bugs (and cause them too üòÖ).
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Sometimes I think back to that Class 6 version of me and laugh:
              <br />
              <strong>"Dude‚Ä¶ you really thought this was black magic."</strong> üòÇ
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">If You're Just Starting Out</h2>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Let me tell you ‚Äî
              <br />
              The uprising of me didn't start in a classroom.
              <br />
              It started with curiosity.
              <br />
              With confusion.
              <br />
              With browser crashes and badly formatted code.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">So if you're on that same path right now?</p>

            <p className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground mt-8">
              Welcome.
              <br />
              It's messy, frustrating, hilarious‚Ä¶
              <br />
              and 100% worth it.
